                    <li>Preventive care, empowering patients to take proactive steps towards maintaining their health and well-being.</li>

                <p>I'm passionate about building strong, trusting relationships with my patients and providing them with the highest quality care possible. I believe in open communication, shared decision-making, and a holistic approach that considers the physical, emotional, and social well-being of each individual.</p>
