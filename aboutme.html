            <h3>Finding Balance</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>
             Beyond the demands of my medical practice, I find immense joy and fulfillment in activities that nurture my mind, body, and spirit. Connecting with my Christian faith provides a sense of grounding and purpose, guiding my interactions with patients and colleagues and enriching my personal life. Immersing myself in a good book offers a welcome escape from the daily routine, nourishes my intellectual curiosity, and broadens my perspectives. Expressing my creativity through cooking, particularly exploring the rich flavors and traditions of Pakistani cuisine, brings me immense joy and allows me to share cultural experiences with others, often with my husband, who is a supportive partner and fellow food enthusiast.

This faith inspires me to approach each patient with compassion, empathy, and a genuine desire to serve.</p>
            
            <p>When I'm not in the office or hospital, you'll often find me exploring the hiking trails around Port St. Lucie with my husband. We love challenging ourselves with new trails, like the Savannas Preserve Trail at the Savannas Preserve State Park, and taking in the beauty of Florida's natural landscape.  It's a wonderful way to stay active and de-stress while enjoying quality time together.</p>

                Reading provides a welcome respite from the demands of medicine, allowing me to explore new worlds, engage with diverse perspectives, and cultivate a lifelong love of learning.

              <p>Expressing my creativity through cooking, particularly exploring the rich flavors and traditions of Pakistani cuisine, brings me immense joy.  I love experimenting with traditional recipes like Biryani, Chicken Korma, and Chicken 65, often with my husband, who is a supportive partner and fellow food enthusiast.  There's nothing quite like the aroma of freshly ground spices and the satisfaction of creating a delicious meal from scratch. Sharing these meals with friends and family creates cherished memories and fosters a sense of community.  <h3><a href="biryani.html"> Click here for my favorite food recipes</a></h3></p>
